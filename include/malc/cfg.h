idle_task_period_us:

  The IDLE task (both internal and on all the destinations) will be run with
  this periodicity.

backoff_max_us:

  Internal fine-tuning. Leave as default or read the sources before setting
  this.

start_own_thread:

  When this is set "malc" will launch and manage a dedicated thread for the
  consumer. If this is unset the logger's consume task is run manually from a
  user thread by using "malc_run_consume_task".

timestamp:

  Timestamp at the producer side. It's slower but more precise. In general if

  at the expense of performance.

msg_allocator:

  Each producer may have a buffer in TLS and a fixed buffer for all the threads,
  when both are exhausted (or disabled) the pointed heap allocator will be used.
  Note that this allocator is only used to enqueue single log entries from the
  heap. All the other dynamic memory is taken from the allocator passed on
  "malc_init".

slot_size:

  All allocations for the produced consumer queue are rounded to ceiling to this
  value. Usually this is intended to be set as the size in bytes of your
  machine's cache line size.

fixed_allocator_bytes:

  The minimal amount of bytes that each fixed allocator will have. This number
  might be rounded up to cache line size or to the next power of 2. 0 disables
  the fixed allocator.

fixed_allocator_max_slots:

  The maximum amount of slots that a single call to the fixed allocator can
  have. The slot size is unspecified so this parameter is a bit vague. Consider
  a slot size equal or very near the cache line size.

fixed_allocator_per_cpu:

  Create one fixed allocator for each CPU core. This is an optimization (or
  pessimization: measure your performance) to alleviate false sharing. Note that
  "fixed_allocator_bytes" is not divided by the number CPUs when this setting is
  active.

sanitize_log_entries:

  The log entries are removed from any character that may make them to be
  confused with another log line, e.g. newline, so log injection isn't possible.

log_rate_filter_watch_count:

  Controls how many different entries log entries can be watched simultaneosly
  by the log rate filter. This number may be limited to be very low (64), as
  calculating the data rate of all the previous entries has performance
  implications. 0 disables the filter.

log_rate_filter_min_severity:

  Controls the lowest severity affected by the log_rate_filter. This is intended
  to let the user decide if the lowest severitites should be filtered or not, as
  these can be used for debugging and stripped from the release executable.

  Both this and is "log_rate_filter_watch_count" are be used together with
  the per-destination (in struct "malc_dst_cfg") "log_rate_filter_time".

log_rate_filter_cutoff_eps:

  Controls the maximum rate that a given log entry can have. The units are
  entries per second.
